Project 2 for big data

To run program simply follow this usage!
Usage: $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit Project2.py <HostUrl> <InputFile> <QueryTerm>

How to run on your local:
From within our project folder,
1. Replace <HostUrl> with "local"
2. Replace <InputFile> with SampleData3.txt
3. Replace <QueryTerm> with gene_nmdars_gene
    So your command should look like:
    $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit Project2.py local SampleData3.txt gene_nmdars_gene

Please ensure that you have Spark installed and can resolve $SPARK_HOME to the correct directory.

Thanks, Enjoy!
